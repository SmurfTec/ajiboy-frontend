          Article 1: Object of the agreement <br /> Botte is a
          commercial company established under Belgian law. The
          purpose of the company is to bring together and to connect
          people who need to transport objects (the item owners or
          possessors) and people who could carry those objects (the
          travellers).
          <br /> Those travellers will perceive an allowance, basing
          on which Botte will deduct a commission.
          <br /> Under no circumstances, Botte shall be considered as

          endorse the transportation of goods by private persons.
          Botte is the owner of a platform and a network of people.

          not interfere in the conclusion nor the execution of the
          agreement.
          <br />
          Therefore, Botte will not bear any liability in case of
          fraud, misunderstanding or lack of execution of the
          agreement. The intervention of Botte regarding to the

          travellers <br /> In order to execute the carrying contract,
          travellers must be in age to contract and accomplish legal

          legal or civic rights cannot subscribe as travellers. The

          theft or fraud cannot be travellers. The travellers aren’t
          employees or attendants of Botte. <br /> There is no
          subordination link between Botte and them. Botte is not
          entitled to exercise a supervisory power on the traveller.

          that may occur during a professional travel requires prior
          notification and approval of both the traveller’s employer
          and Botte. Professional transporters cannot carry items
          during their journeys. <br />

          by the traveller, who will receive no other benefit that the
          “all-inclusive” allowance.

          The requester has to be in age to contract and accomplish a

          unavoidable expenses have to be exposed during the travel
          and that they have not been foreseen by the requester, those
          will be automatically charged to him, without any
          possibility of waiving those costs.

          addressee will be present at the agreed time and place of

          or fragile object shall be packaged in presence of the

          item and the packaging prior to the traveller to make sure

          traveller has the duty to refuse to proceed to carrying.

          Article 9: transport and risks <br /> It is the traveller’s
          duty to insure that the transportation is made with caution
          and without any risk to arm, break or cause damage to the
          carried item.
          <br /> The traveller will also make sure that transportation
          will also be made in conformity with the sanitary and legal
          recommendation. Botte shall not be held responsible for the
          loss, the deterioration or the theft of the carried item
          during the whole traveling time.
          <br /> The traveling time starts when the item if picked up
          by the travellers and ends when it is delivered to the
          person who signs the delivery form. As demander of the
          travel, the requester will be in charge of any customs
          related or regulatory related claim or dispute resulting of
          the carrying.
          <br /> The traveller shall be considered as the guardian of
          the object. He is the depositor of the precarious possession
          of the carried item. Therefore, he will be held liable for
          any loss or damage caused by the item or its behaviour
          during transportation.
          <br /> Under certain circumstances, Botte offers an
          insurance to cover certain losses or damages. Any franchise
          will be exposed by the beneficiary of the insurance.
          <br /> Except those cases, Botte will decline any
          responsibility.

          the moment of the conclusion of the agreement. Botte uses
          its experience to propose informative usually applied rates.
          <br /> If the item has to be bought or if some payments have
          to be done in order to take possession of the item, those
          amounts will be advanced by the travellers in the first
          instance.
          <br /> The payment of the item’s price (in case of a new
          item that has to be bought), the potential costs and fees
          and the “all-inclusive allowance” are made directly to Botte
          prior to the travel.
          <br />
          Under no circumstances the travel can be executed before
          reception and notification of the reception by Botte. If the
          parties execute the carrying without previous payment, Botte
          shall offer no guarantee concerning the payment of the
          allowance or any other amount arising from the agreement or
          its execution. <br />
          As soon as Botte receives the confirmation of the delivery
          by the addressee, Botte proceeds within the seven days to
          the payment of the allowance, the potential costs and other
          amounts, minus the commission that is due to Botte. Payment

          loss due to the failure of the Bank’s or P.O.’s system or
          due to an improper use of the system.
