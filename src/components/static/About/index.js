          How it started - a bit of history/backstory. A few years
          ago, Ayo and Stephen noticed they were getting several
          requests from family and friends to assist with couriering
          small items.
          <br /> However, there was some frustration with date
          mismatch leading to long waits or discovering too late about
          journeys. Our light-bulb moment was in realising that
          multiple flights go between these locations with lots of
          passengers not fully utilising their luggage allowance.

          We leverage existing journeys to courier parcels by
          utilising unused luggage space of regular travellers. The
          power is yours - you can courier parcels and you can send
          them.
