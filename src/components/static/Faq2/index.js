                  If I want to bid for and suggest an experience or
                  item that is not typical, there is no set place or
                  way to do this that has enough attention to make it
                  a reality and be noticed.

                <p>
                  Equally, brands, personalities and items leave a lot
                  of value on the table that can easily be captured by
                  either their creativity or their fan’s/follower’s
                  creativity.

                  LotPot makes this simple – you can propose anything
                  you’re willing to pay for, and the claimant knows
                  exactly who is offering, what for, and for how much.
                  Taking all the guess work and effort out of
                  providing the best services and engagement possible.

                <p>
                  LotPot is an auction marketplace where you can
                  propose the buying and selling of any item or
                  experience you want that you cannot get normally.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You can create an auction proposing what the item or
                  experience you want and who can fulfil it – anything
                  from a strange item, an experience with a celebrity,
                  influencer, brand, or business. Get creative!
                </p>
                <p>
                  The claimant you propose can be a specific
                  individual or business that you identify with their
                  social media handles, or open-ended and free for
                  multiple people to offer to claim!
                </p>
                <p>
                  The auction runs for either 1, 2, or 3 weeks and the
                  top bidder at the end wins. The claimant is
                  notified, and the winner and claimant can chat to
                  decide and tweak the details before the offer is
                  accepted.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The auction and offer are purely hypothetical at
                  this point until the claimant decides to offer the
                  item or service or not.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At that point the claimant can accept the offer at
                  the final price and only then is the bidder’s card
                  charged and paid to the claimant, with LotPot taking
                  our commission in between of course 😉 Done!
                </p>
                <p>
                  A dream comes true that would have been impossible
                  and not even proposed otherwise and we make the
                  world a more fun and interesting place.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Beyond the point of sale of an item or experience,
                  LotPots are unique opportunities to engage with
                  fans, communities, have an amazing experience,
                  create amazing content and collaborations, and
                  create value in any way imaginable!

                  Honestly, anything you’d want, ever dreamed of, or
                  are just curious about. As big or as small as you’d
                  like.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We find it’s easier to come up with one when you
                  think about things you’re a fan of, follower of, or
                  obsessed with. There’s no limits and you can be as
                  weird and ridiculous as you like, after all it’s all
                  hypothetical until someone agrees!
                </p>
                <p>
                  We also categorise all LotPots so it makes it easier
                  for you:

                <p>
                  *Remember, you don’t even have to make an auction
                  for yourself to win. Create an interesting auction
                  and let someone else bid and win! You’ll get 1% just
                  for your creativity…for the right auctions those can
                  really add up 👀
                </p>

                  You need to stand out from the crowd from the very
                  start!
                </p>
                <p>
                  This means a catchy but informative title and if
                  it’s about a person or a business…you guessed it,
                  you should include it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Categories are everything. If you pick the wrong one
                  your auction will never be seen by the right people
                  and it will never resonate as well as it could have
                  done, so think hard on the mix of categories you
                  set.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Don’t think about the number of eyes seeing it - the
                  better you make, curate, and place your auction the
                  more likely it is to be claimed in the end and
                  resonate with the right people. You’re ultimately
                  going after the people that have a cult-following
                  like interest in your auction.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The images you pick are critical, and if in doubt
                  make your own thumbnail or explainer video as the
                  extra effort goes a long way with the claimants and
                  engagement to get noticed and reshared.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                  Each auction is almost a piece of content and art,
                  take care in the details – sloppy work seems like
                  it’s barely wanted long shots. And they rarely do
                  better than a well titled auction with a catchy
                  jovial description with a nice picture or 1 minute
                  explainer video.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Treat it like a tiktok or a mini youtube video and
                  you’ll beat everyone’s attention and shareability.
                  It’s not all about the idea – presentation counts 😉

                  Our sole purpose is to make dreams and interesting

                  LotPot auctions are hypothetical in nature – so the
                  final price and person get decided, making creating
                  this value or service ridiculously easy for the
                  claimant to decide to take the money and provide the
                  item/service.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While other marketplaces must make partnerships and
                  value through only what is assured, leaving the
                  truly interesting value on the table and ignoring
                  their audience’s wants and needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We are much more than just a marketplace – in the
                  right hands we’re a powerful tool for driving
                  engagement, virality, competition, business, and of
                  course making money. We believe every influencer,
                  celebrity, brand, business, and every single person
                  can use LotPot to enhance and showcase what they’re
                  all about and get paid for it – and have a great
                  experience at the same time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We literally value creativity – for simply creating
                  an auction idea you receive 1% of the ticket price
                  if it is claimed in the end. There’s no limit to the
                  number of auctions you can create, the only limit is
                  creativity and there’s no end of interesting things
                  you could propose.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Most marketplaces are focused purely on the
                  transaction where the role of the user is limited.
                  LotPot nurtures users of all kinds and progresses
                  with them to create increased value for everyone
                  over time. Auction creators can pay for exactly what
                  they want and in turn can create auctions for others
                  and get paid commission. Claimants get money and
                  engagement and often accept and create more auctions
                  in the future, bigger and better than before.
                  Auction idea creators and buyers eventually sell an
                  auction item or experience about themselves for
                  higher values and change their lives potentially.

                  is charged for the full amount and LotPot takes the

                  The best thing you can do to offer the best LotPot,

                  reshare it to your following, ask them questions,

                  interest to your following that you’ll accept and
                  even propose some of the details or how you could

                <p>
                  Capitalise on the opportunity – the LotPot can
                  create value for the item or experience you can
                  offer easily, but it’s also a way to boost your

                  A specific auction is the usual kind on LotPot. This
                  is when an auction is about, and can be claimed, by
                  only a specific individual or brand etc. The
                  official social media handles are supplied when
                  making the auction so only the correct person can be
                  verified to claim and supply the auction conditions.{' '}
                </p>
                <p>Example, the first auction ever created here: </p>
                <p>
                  A weekend experience with Jocko Willink (the famous
                  Navy Seal, he’s amazing check him out) – this is
                  specifically about Jocko and only his official

                  An open-ended auction is one where an item or
                  experience is proposed and bid on that can be
                  supplied or claimed by a number of different people
                  or brands or a number of similar items etc. The top
                  bidder who won can then pick from any of the valid
                  candidates trying to offer the item or experience.{' '}

                <p>Example of an open-ended auction: </p>
                <p>
                  Tickets to the Met Gala – multiple people might be
                  able to make this happen so it remains open ended so
                  you can get multiple valid responses!

                  No. We do not facilitate any refunds as there are so
                  many stages in accepting and paying for an auction
                  in the first place – it’s created with intent and
                  the details are specified before acceptance, as are
                  each parties contact information for detail changes.{' '}
